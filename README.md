# Parsebrain
ParseBrain is a library built on top of speechbrain wich is itself built on pytorch.
## Objectives 
The objectives of this library is to be a modulable and easily extendable library for parsing related task and to be invariant to the change in modality (text and speech)
## Versatility
The main strength of parsebrain is the versatility, every recipe can work by just slightly tweaking the yaml when you go from working on speech to text.

Then you can juste git clone this repository and 
```
